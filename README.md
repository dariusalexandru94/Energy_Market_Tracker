# Energy Market Tracker Pipeline for Apache Cassandra DW

This project aims to **collect daily data** on energy sector prices (such as oil, natural gas, solar energy, wind energy, nuclear energy, and coal) and **store it** in an **Apache Cassandra Data Warehouse** for analysis.

For this project I have used the following sources:
* www.oilprice.com - Oilprice.com is the most popular energy news site in the world
* www.trandingeconomics.com - provides over 20 million economic indicators for 196 countries
* www.markets.businessinsider.com - an American media company known for publishing financial news
